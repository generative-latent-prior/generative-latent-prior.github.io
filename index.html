            Existing approaches for analyzing neural network activations, such as PCA and sparse autoencoders, rely on strong structural assumptions.
            Generative models offer an alternative: they can uncover structure without such assumptions and act as priors that improve intervention fidelity.
            We explore this direction by training diffusion models on one billion residual stream activations, creating "meta-models" that learn the distribution of a network's internal states.
            We find that diffusion loss decreases smoothly with compute and reliably predicts downstream utility.
            In particular, applying the meta-model's learned prior to steering interventions improves fluency, with larger gains as loss decreases.
            Moreover, the meta-model's neurons increasingly isolate concepts into individual units, with sparse probing scores that scale as loss decreases.
            These results suggest generative meta-models offer a scalable path toward interpretability without restrictive structural assumptions.

        <div class="content has-text-left">
          <p>
            <span class="glp">GLP</span> stands for Generative Latent Prior, and it's our proposed activation diffusion model.
            We train <span class="glp">GLP</span>s on the same activation data commonly used to train sparse autoencoders, or <a href="https://github.com/EleutherAI/sparsify" target="_blank">SAEs</a>.
            Unlike SAEs, <span class="glp">GLP</span>s pose no architectural constraints, and we parameterize them as deep multi-layer MLPs.
            We study <span class="glp">GLP</span>s trained on <a href="https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B" target="_blank">Llama1B</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B" target="_blank">Llama8B</a> activations, with <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb" target="_blank">FineWeb</a> as our pre-training corpus.
            In this work, we show that <span class="glp">GLP</span>s can be quite useful for downstream interpretability tasks; see more below.

            We show that <span class="glp">GLP</span> can be used for on-manifold steering,
            by post-processing intervened activations with diffusion sampling.
            <span class="glp">GLP</span> expands the Pareto frontier in many steering settings, as demonstrated for evil persona steering below.

            To understand the scaling properties of <span class="glp">GLP</span>, we train Llama1B <span class="glp">GLP</span>s of varying sizes. We see that the diffusion loss reliably decreases as a function of compute, and is a reasonable proxy for downstream metrics like steering and probing performance.
